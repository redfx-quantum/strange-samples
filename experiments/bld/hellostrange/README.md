This sample is using the bld build tool to compile and run a Java application
using strange.

Usage:
`./bld download`
`./bld compile`
`./bld run`

The output of the last command is similar to the following:

```
Using high-level Strange API to generate random bits
----------------------------------------------------
Generate one random bit, which can be 0 or 1. Result = 0
Generated 10000 random bits, 4935 of them were 0, and 5065 were 1.
```
